to find the transpose of a matrix in place, i.e., without making another matrix fo n x n size;

NOTE: THE KEY OBSERVATION IS THAT THE DIAGONAL ELEMENTS REMAINS UNCHANGED EVEN IN THE TRANSPOSE AND WE ONLY HAVE TO CHANGE THE POSITION OF 
REST ELEMENTS

for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]);
            }
        }
